# Tests

The tests are divided into grammar checks, in `Grammar`, and parsing tests, in `Parsing`.

There is an environment parallel of this directory, its path can be found in the
environment variable `BG_LIB_TESTS` (currently `Environment/Tests`).

If `Grammar` is missing here look in the environment, ditto for `Parsing` but that
is less likely not to be here.
