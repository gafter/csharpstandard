      /* While a *type_argument_list* occurring within a *query_expression* before a query
         contextual keyword is syntactically supported we do not have a sample which uses
         it and makes semantic sense (the above samples all at least make vague sense),
         so instead we take the semantically valid:

            var query = from c in customers
                        let d = c
                        where d != null
                        join c1 in customers on c1.GetHashCode() equals c.GetHashCode()
                        join c1 in customers on c1.GetHashCode() equals c.GetHashCode() into e
                        group c by c.Country
                            into g
                            orderby g.Count() ascending
                            orderby g.Key descending
                            select new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count() };

          and liberally sprinkle *type_argument_list*s where syntactically allowed and
          use that as a testâ€¦
